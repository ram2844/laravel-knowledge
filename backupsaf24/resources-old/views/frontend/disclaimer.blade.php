				<!-- <p class="sub-title">Spread across a patch of Panaji skirting the river Mandovi, the Festival locations have been strategically chosen for their historical value, natural beauty, and affinity to the arts. The initiatives undertaken by the Festival are set to transform these venues into spaces where audiences from all walks of life can experience the wonder of the arts in new and exciting contextsâ€”an endeavour that will turn the Mandovi waterfront into a hub of cultural activity. With its close-knit networks and practical commute options, Serendipity Arts Festival promises to be accessible to all.</p>  -->
